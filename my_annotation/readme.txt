INPUT: coef.txt, RPV

1. run annotation_html.pl first to annotate the final set of biomarkers based on a list of variables with coefficients (coef.txt). Also requires a list of genes with gene index (RPV.csv). Returns a html report.

2. run my_annotate.pl to annotate a list genes generated by wavelet variance in MATLAB. The list consists of genes ranked based on thier rpv

3. run my_ann_disc_var.pl to annotate the final set of biomarkers based on a cofficient and wilks' lambda. Also requires a list of genes with gene index (RPV.csv)
