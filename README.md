# Microarray_Analysis

Prediction  of Potential Biomarkers for Ovarian Cancer using Gene Expression Profiles. 

Microarray is a tool used to identify whether the sequence from a particular DNA sample contains any genetic mutation by analysing the related gene expression profiles. The scripts include tools for data extraction, pre-processing, normalization, selection and data reduction. A set of scripts was also developed for gene annotation allowing users to determine any relevant biological information associated with abnormally expressed genes. The annotation scripts also allow users to automatically generate viasually appealing reports.
